Two homogeneous ensemble models are proposed to predict infection levels and mortality of COVID-19 patients in China. New findings of clinical features for benefiting the machine learning models are reported. The evaluation of an actual dataset collected from January 3 to March 8, 2020 demonstrates the effectiveness of the models by comparing them with state-of-the-art models in prediction.
